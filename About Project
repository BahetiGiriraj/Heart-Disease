Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a comprehensive machine learning pipeline designed to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals based on various health attributes. It demonstrates key steps in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation.

Key Features:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand data patterns and relationships.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Implements and compares several machine learning models, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Gradient Boosting
- Performance Metrics: Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curves.

Project Workflow:

1. Import Libraries: Load required Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
2. Load Dataset: Use the dataset containing health-related features for heart disease prediction.
3. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Scale features for model compatibility.
4. EDA:
